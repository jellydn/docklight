## Codebase Patterns
- Use native `<select>` elements for dropdowns (no custom Select component)
- Toast only supports "success" or "error" types, not "warning"
- Deployment settings API uses PUT /api/apps/:name/deployment

## 2026-02-28 20:15 +08 - US-014
[Session: ]
- Implemented enhanced CreateAppDialog with collapsible Advanced Options section
- Added deployment settings fields: Deploy Branch, Build Directory, Builder dropdown
- On app creation, POST /api/apps is called first, then PUT /api/apps/:name/deployment for advanced settings
- If advanced settings fail, app is still created but shows warning message and toast
- Existing name-only flow works identically when advanced section is collapsed
- Files changed: client/src/components/CreateAppDialog.tsx, scripts/ralph/prd.json
- Typecheck: PASSED, Lint: PASSED, Tests: pre-existing failures unrelated to changes
**Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Test failures in this codebase are pre-existing environment issues (vi.mocked not available, document not defined in test env)
  - Always run lint/format before committing as pre-commit hooks will fail
