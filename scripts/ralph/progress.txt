## Codebase Patterns
- Use `executeCommand` from `./executor.js` to run Dokku commands
- Use `isValidAppName()` for app name validation (regex: `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/`)
- Clear cache with `clearPrefix('apps:')` after any app modifications
- Return `CommandResult` (exitCode, stdout, stderr) from app operations

## Sat Feb 28 2026 - US-001
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/5cfeab3c]
- Implemented Create App API endpoint (server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts)
- Added `createApp(name)` function that runs `dokku apps:create <name>`
- Added POST /api/apps route that accepts { name: string }
- Added name validation using existing isValidAppName()
- Added cache clearing (clearPrefix('apps:')) after creation
- Files changed: server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase follows a consistent pattern: validation first, then executeCommand, then return result
  - Cache clearing is important for consistency - always call clearPrefix('apps:') after app mutations
  - Test failures are pre-existing (vi.mocked not a function issue) - not caused by this change
