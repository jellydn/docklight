## [Fri Feb 27 2026] - US-004
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/]
- Created frontend scaffold with React + Vite + TypeScript
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v3
- Installed react-router-dom for routing
- Created AppLayout component with left sidebar (Dashboard, Apps, Databases links) and main content area
- Set up routes: /login, /dashboard, /apps, /apps/:name, /databases
- Created API client utility at client/src/lib/api.ts with fetch wrapper that handles auth (redirects to /login on 401)
- Configured Vite proxy to forward /api/* to backend (http://localhost:3001) in development
- Created placeholder pages for all routes
- Added typecheck script to package.json
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: client/package.json, client/tsconfig.json, client/vite.config.ts, client/tailwind.config.js, client/postcss.config.js, client/src/index.css, client/src/App.tsx, client/src/components/AppLayout.tsx, client/src/lib/api.ts, client/src/pages/*.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS v3 requires specifying content paths in config
  - Vite proxy configured to forward /api/* to backend during development
  - API client uses credentials: 'include' to send cookies with requests
  - React Router uses <Outlet /> for nested route rendering in AppLayout

## [Fri Feb 27 2026] - US-005
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/]
- Implemented login page UI with form handling and error display
- Added password input field and submit button to Login page
- Implemented form submission calling POST /api/auth/login with entered password
- On successful login, redirects to /dashboard
- On failure, displays error message 'Invalid password'
- Added authentication check on mount - if already authenticated (GET /api/auth/me returns 200), redirects to /dashboard
- Added logout button in sidebar calling POST /api/auth/logout and redirecting to /login
- Typecheck passes
- Browser verification skipped due to ChromeDevTools MCP not configured
- Files changed: client/src/pages/Login.tsx, client/src/components/AppLayout.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Login component checks /api/auth/me on mount to redirect authenticated users
  - Logout button uses onClick handler instead of Link for POST request
  - Form uses React controlled component pattern for password state

## [Fri Feb 27 2026] - US-006
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/]
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile: stage 1 builds client with Vite, stage 2 builds server TypeScript, stage 3 runs Node.js serving SPA + API
- Updated server/index.ts to serve client/dist as static files with express.static
- Added SPA fallback for client-side routing with wildcard route sending index.html
- Created Procfile with web process type running node server/dist/index.js
- Created app.json with healthcheck pointing to /api/health
- Created .dockerignore excluding node_modules, .git, data/
- EXPOSE port uses PORT env var (default 3001) matching Express PORT
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, Procfile, app.json, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile separates build and runtime for smaller image size
  - SPA fallback must come after static file serving in Express middleware order
  - Client dist path is ../client/dist relative to server/ directory

## [Fri Feb 27 2026] - US-007
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/]
- Implemented GET /api/apps endpoint calling 'dokku apps:list' and 'dokku ps:report' via shell executor
- Created server/lib/apps.ts with getApps() function
- Parses dokku output into JSON array: [{ name, status (running/stopped), domains, lastDeployTime }]
- Domains parsed from 'dokku domains:report <app>' for each app
- Returns empty array if no apps exist
- Errors return { error, command, exitCode, stderr } object
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dokku commands called via executor with proper error handling
  - Status determined by checking for 'deployed' in ps:report output
  - Deploy time parsed from 'deployed at' timestamp using regex
  - Domains extracted from 'domains vhosts' field in domains:report

## [Fri Feb 27 2026] - US-008
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/]
- Implemented GET /api/server/health endpoint returning { cpu, memory, disk } as percentages 0-100
- Created server/lib/server.ts with getServerHealth() function
- CPU parsed from /proc/stat using awk to calculate usage percentage
- Memory parsed from 'free -m' output (used/total percentage)
- Disk parsed from 'df -h /' output (percentage column)
- Values clamped to 0-100 range
- Errors return { error, command, exitCode, stderr } object
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: server/lib/server.ts, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CPU usage calculated from /proc/stat user+nice time vs total time
  - awk used for parsing Linux system files efficiently
  - Memory percentage calculated from used vs total in MB
  - Disk percentage extracted from df output using awk

## [Fri Feb 27 2026] - US-009
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/]
- Implemented dashboard page UI at /dashboard with server health, apps list, and recent activity
- Server health bar at top showing CPU, memory, disk with color coding (green <60%, yellow <85%, red >=85%)
- Apps table with columns: Name, Status (badge), Domains, Last Deploy
- App name is a Link to /apps/:name
- Loading spinner shown while fetching data
- Error state displays message if API fails
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds using setInterval
- Recent Activity section showing last 20 commands from GET /api/commands
- Typecheck passes
- Browser verification skipped due to ChromeDevTools MCP not configured
- Files changed: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useEffect with empty deps runs once and clears interval on unmount
  - Promise.all used to fetch multiple API endpoints in parallel
  - Tailwind utility classes used for conditional styling and responsive layout
  - Link component from react-router-dom for client-side navigation
