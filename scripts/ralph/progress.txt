## Codebase Patterns
- Use `executeCommand` from `./executor.js` to run Dokku commands
- Use `isValidAppName()` for app name validation (regex: `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/`)
- Clear cache with `clearPrefix('apps:')` after any app modifications
- Return `CommandResult` (exitCode, stdout, stderr) from app operations

## Sat Feb 28 2026 - US-001
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/5cfeab3c]
- Implemented Create App API endpoint (server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts)
- Added `createApp(name)` function that runs `dokku apps:create <name>`
- Added POST /api/apps route that accepts { name: string }
- Added name validation using existing isValidAppName()
- Added cache clearing (clearPrefix('apps:')) after creation
- Files changed: server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase follows a consistent pattern: validation first, then executeCommand, then return result
  - Cache clearing is important for consistency - always call clearPrefix('apps:') after app mutations
  - Test failures are pre-existing (vi.mocked not a function issue) - not caused by this change

## Sat Feb 28 2026 - US-002
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/5cfeab3c]
- Implemented Destroy App API endpoint (server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts)
- Added `destroyApp(name, confirmName)` function that runs `dokku apps:destroy <name> --force`
- Added DELETE /api/apps/:name route that accepts { confirmName: string }
- Added validation to ensure confirmName matches name before executing
- Added cache clearing (clearPrefix('apps:')) after destruction
- Files changed: server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The destroy endpoint requires typing the app name for confirmation - this is a safety feature
  - The endpoint returns CommandResult which includes exitCode, stdout, stderr
  - Typecheck and lint pass without issues

## Sat Feb 28 2026 - US-003
[Session: https://opncd.ai/s/5cfeab3c]
- Implemented Stop and Start App API endpoints (server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts)
- Added `stopApp(name)` function that runs `dokku ps:stop <name>`
- Added `startApp(name)` function that runs `dokku ps:start <name>`
- Added POST /api/apps/:name/stop route
- Added POST /api/apps/:name/start route
- Both endpoints validate app name with isValidAppName()
- Both clear apps cache after each action
- Files changed: server/lib/apps.ts, server/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow the same pattern as restartApp and rebuildApp for consistency
  - Typecheck and lint pass
  - Test failures are pre-existing (vi.mocked not a function issue)
